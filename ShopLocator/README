Decided to use double for latitude/longitude after reading 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6754881/java-double-vs-bigdecimal-for-latitude-longtitude

to use the application we can use run the class RestServer
the urls
 http://localhost:8080/rest/ShopLocatorService/addShop
 http://localhost:8080/rest/ShopLocatorService/selectClosestShop
 http://localhost:8080/rest/ShopLocatorService/getShopList
 http://localhost:8080/rest/rest/ShopLocatorService/test
 
 allow us to play with the application 
 we can also use curl e.g.
 curl  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"name":"HawthorneClose","number":"2","postCode":"n14aw"}' http://localhost:8080/rest/ShopLocatorService/addShop
 
 to enable security (which I am having some trouble with) the application 
 needs to have the maven element spring-security-config uncommented 
 to have the rest calls work without entering the user/password 
 we can uncomment the 
 //@ImportResource("classpath:security.xml") 
 in the RestServer class.
 our urls then need to have "?j_username=normal_user&j_password=password"
 appended and we can continue to use it.
